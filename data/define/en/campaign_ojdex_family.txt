<0000> Welcome home, you two. Oh?
// (poppomama)
<0001> Lulu, why are you carrying Ellie on your back? Is she hurt?
// (elliehyper)
<0002> Zzz... Srrnt.
// (lulu)
<0003> Oof... No. She started throwing a tantrum in the middle of town, saying she wanted to be a dragon rider because it would look super heroic.
// (lulu)
<0004> So Lulu gave in and gave her a piggy back, just for a second...
// (poppomama)
<0005> And she fell asleep.
// (lulu)
<0006> She fell asleep! Nothing Lulu tried will wake her up... She's been drooling on the back of Lulu's neck the whole time.
// (poppomama)
<0007> Ufufu. She must feel very safe with you to po-tect her.
// (lulu)
<0008> Lulu wonders about that...
// (poppomama)
<0009> Oh, dear. Come over here. You can tell Mother what's bothering you.
// (lulu)
<0010> Well... Lulu's just worried, since now she knows she was created by an evil lady and she has a dark side and everything...
// (lulu)
<0011> She's worried about what that means, and whether Lulu can be a regular person or not.
// (poppomama)
<0012> Ufufu. I don't think you need to worry about that. Actually... Mother is exactly the same way ♥
// (lulu)
<0013> W-what?
// (poppomama)
<0014> You see, Mother - and actually, Ellie's papa as well - were created by Tomomo, just like you were created by Mio.
// (lulu)
<0015> R-really? So, Lulu... and Ellie's mama... we're the same?
// (poppomama)
<0016> Yes, dear. But despite being created by a middle-aged lady...
// (poppomama)
<0017> Mother still managed to have many adventures, fall in love, and have a wonderful baby girl.
// (poppomama)
<0018> If I can do it, I'm sure that you can, too.
// (lulu)
<0019> ...Thank you very much. That makes Lulu feel a lot better.
// (poppomama)
<0020> No, thank you for being a good friend to my daughter. Please keep looking after her.
// (lulu)
<0021> Lulu will do her very best!
// (poppomama)
<0022> Good girl ♥\nActually, you could treat Mother as your Mother too, if you like.
// (lulu)
<0023> Uwawawa! Lulu's... Lulu's heart isn't ready for that kind of commitment...
// (poppomama)
<0024> Well, please think about it. After seeing the way Mio treated you, Mother got the urge to steal you away for herself.
// (lulu)
<0025> Eek... Lulu feels like she just heard something dangerous...
// (lulu)
<0026> Oh! But, can Lulu please put Ellie down now? She's still drooling, and Lulu's back is getting sore...
// (poppomama)
<0027> Only if you say the magic word.
// (lulu)
<0028> Please? But Lulu already said please, though.
// (poppomama)
<0029> No. It's "Please, Mother." ♥
// (elliehyper)
<0030> Zzz... Let's have... even more adventures tomorrow... Lulu... *drool*
// (lulu)
<0031> Waaahh... At this rate, Lulu can't tell if she's a lucky dragon or not...
