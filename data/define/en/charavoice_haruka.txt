<0000> Ey.
<0001> There.
<0002> Hoy.
<0003> There you go.
<0004> Now's the time to play a card!
<0005> Well, I think I'll use this one.
<0006> Something's telling me this is my chance!
<0007> Hmm, I'll just play this.
<0008> Gonna set a trap here.
<0009> It's dangerous around here. Better watch out.
<0010> I'm sneakily putting something unsafe down here.
<0011> Boy, this trap is insane ♥
<0012> I'll smash you with this card!
<0013> I'm gonna win this one whatever it takes!
<0014> Sorry, but no mercy!
<0015> Here comes a chaaance!
<0016> Heheh, this is getting fun.
<0017> That was close.
<0018> The game isn't over yet!
<0019> Ugh, is it just me or am falling way behind the others?
<0020> Let's get going again!
<0021> There's not much you can do while you're down, huh?
<0022> I wanna go around the field agaaain.
<0023> No use in feeling rushed. I'll have some juice.
<0024> Not my lucky daaay.
<0025> Boom!
<0026> Attack!
<0027> I'll go attack now!
<0028> Karate chop!
<0029> Ouch!
<0030> Oww!
<0031> That's not good.
<0032> Argh!
<0033> I have to get myself ready to go again.
<0034> This is awesome.
<0035> HP management is crucial.
<0036> Phew, I was almost done for.
<0037> Warp!?
<0038> Where will I get to?
<0039> Awawah.
<0040> Whoa, it's a warp.
<0041> Gyaah.
<0042> You've gotta be kidding me, no?
<0043> For reals!?
<0044> I messed uuup!
<0045> I'm about to hunt you!
<0046> You're getting knocked down.
<0047> I think I have a fair chance against you!
<0048> Fighting a battle here seems like a good idea to me.
<0049> So you want a piece of me, huh?
<0050> Getting physical isn't good.
<0051> Look at how aggressive you're being.
<0052> I don't feel like getting my butt kicked right now...
<0053> Punch!
<0054> Kick!
<0055> Home run!
<0056> Drop dead!
<0057> That hurt!
<0058> You suck!
<0059> Knock it off!
<0060> Uwaah!
<0061> Gyan!
<0062> Couldn't you have taken it a bit easier on me?
<0063> Can something like this really be allowed to happen?
<0064> I am in huge trouble...!
<0065> I have amazing reflexes, don't I?
<0066> Dodging like a pro!
<0067> You can dodge it, Haruka.
<0068> This makes me pretty nervous.
<0069> Yaaay, I won!
<0070> I'm quite a fighter, aren't I?
<0071> That's tasty ♥
<0072> Hooray, I did it!
<0073> Ugh.
<0074> I could've done better.
<0075> Damn, I got that wrong.
<0076> Um, damn it.
<0077> Got some allowance.
<0078> Boy, this feels great.
<0079> Yes, yes!
<0080> Oh, I got lucky.
<0081> Nooo!
<0082> You've got to be kidding me.
<0083> Stop! Stop! I said stooop!
<0084> Ahhh!!!
<0085> What the? A trap?
<0086> Seriously?
<0087> Here, of all places?
<0088> I fell for it...!
<0089> Here comes the boss!
<0090> I might be in trouble.
<0091> Things are getting a bit tense.
<0092> Can you please kick everyone's ass but mine?
<0093> Let me demonstrate how skilled I am at saving money.
<0094> Because I'm aiming to be rich!
<0095> Feels amazing to have a bunch of stars, doesn't it?
<0096> I'm not an awesome fighter, so... my choice is this.
<0097> Maybe I'll do better if I treat fighting like a sport...?
<0098> Given the current situation, this would be a better choice.
<0099> Hmm, I'm torn, but I've got a feeling this is the right choice!
<0100> I'm gonna go for fighting!
<0101> Haruka here. Good to meet you.
<0102> 100% OJ again today? Sure, let's play!
<0103> Playing 100% OJ with me? I'm not that good; is that okay?
<0104> I'm feeling lucky today, so I'll probably win!
<0105> Alright, let's get going!
<0106> Let's play a good game.
<0107> Here we go!
<0108> Time to start ♥
<0109> Hooray! I won!
<0110> That was so much fun. We should do this again sometime.
<0111> I think I've been on my game lately.
<0112> This is a feel-good victory.
<0113> I like gacha.
<0114> Can't wait to see what we got, right?
<0115> Did you get something cute?
<0116> Are we gonna get stronger with that?
<0117> I don't push myself too hard.
<0118> I have to ask for a switch.
<0119> Alright, you got this.
<0120> About time to change positions.
<0121> Gotcha.
<0122> Oh, that's double good.
<0123> Yes!
<0124> Uh-uh.
<0125> Oh no...
<0126> You're so lucky! I'm happy for you!
<0127> Uuum?
<0128> Let's get started.
<0129> Dice roll!
<0130> You can do it! I'm rooting for you!
<0131> Hello!
<0132> Um... Hmm?
<0133> Well done! Amazing!
<0134> That's so super fantastic!
<0135> I hate this...
<0136> I'll play a card that I stole.
<0137> This card, let's find out if it'll get along with me.
<0138> It's a gamble to see what happens.
<0139> Not too familiar, but I hope it'll work out!
<0140> Thanks!
<0141> You better not say that out loud!
<0142> I know, but following your hunch is also valuable!
<0143> I know, right! You can praise me more ♥
<0144> You didn't, did you? I can see you're kind of sweating, Big Sis ♥
<0145> Kana's doing her thing again, giving off that strong-player vibe.
<0146> Kana's playing without thinking a lot...
<0147> Kana, don't be too tough on me, okay?
<0148> Okay, let's show everyone how well we're getting along!
<0149> Oh, there's Poyo.
<0150> Let's have a blast, Poyo.
<0151> Of course I'll play with everything I've got.
<0152> They say those who have fun, win!
<0153> You're so cool, Sora. I can't get enough of you.
<0154> Oh, it's Sora.
<0155> OMG, I won a battle against Sora...
<0156> Awesome, the ultimate weapon's pretty strong.
<0157> Hey, Kana, you okay?
<0158> That's my sister...!
<0159> We are the strongest!
<0160> 100% OJ Club, let's go!
<0161> Oh my god! That's really them!
<0162> C-Can I have your... autographs...?
<0163> Man, idols are super cute.
