<0000> It's my turn!
<0001> Let's go!
<0002> There!
<0003> Rolling.
<0004> Let me show you my strat!
<0005> Lemme play a card.
<0006> Let's see how this card will help!
<0007> Take this, ba-bang!
<0008> A trap!
<0009> Hehehe, there's a trap here.
<0010> Oh boy, what am I doing, setting a trap in a place like this â™ª
<0011> Let's see how this'll work out.
<0012> I think I have to win this one.
<0013> I won't go easy on you!
<0014> Losing this battle would be a pain, so.
<0015> I'm turning the tide!
<0016> Here's Poyo Oage's special technique!
<0017> Phew, that was upsetting.
<0018> I'm still in this. I can win this game.
<0019> Ugh, I think I'm in a real bind... But I can still claw my way to victory...
<0020> Now that I'm back up, you'll all witness a dramatic comeback win!
<0021> Uwoo, I thought I'd get back up for sure.
<0022> Oh shoot! This is bad...
<0023> Man, things aren't going well for me.
<0024> Ugh, this doesn't feel great...
<0025> I'll go on the offensive!
<0026> Time to attack!
<0027> Guess I'll grab myself some wins.
<0028> Brace for my attack.
<0029> Ugh.
<0030> Stop, stop.
<0031> Whoa.
<0032> What the heck?
<0033> That was a close one.
<0034> Gotta restore my HP.
<0035> I ain't gonna go down now.
<0036> Recovery is important!
<0037> Wa-wa.
<0038> Oh boy.
<0039> Warp!
<0040> Hmm?
<0041> Oops.
<0042> For real?
<0043> You gotta be kidding me.
<0044> I screwed up...
<0045> I've got you cornered!
<0046> I won't let up the pressure!
<0047> Let's knock you down!
<0048> Alright, I'm kicking off my attack.
<0049> Challenge accepted!
<0050> Whoa whoa, you wanna fight me?
<0051> Oh, you wanna fight me.
<0052> Maybe this'll be a hard one for me?
<0053> Take this!
<0054> I'm knocking you down a peg!
<0055> Attaaack!
<0056> Gooo!
<0057> Gyafu.
<0058> Oh shoot!
<0059> Ugh, this is nothing...!
<0060> Wah!
<0061> Oh em gee, this is so bad!
<0062> Hold on a second.
<0063> Isn't that unfair?
<0064> Noo, this ain't happening.
<0065> That was seriously so close.
<0066> Dodged successfully.
<0067> Phew.
<0068> Alright, no damage taken!
<0069> Alright!
<0070> Hehe, I knocked you down.
<0071> Yaaay!
<0072> I did it!
<0073> Oh, come on!
<0074> Heeen, I'm in agony.
<0075> Why?
<0076> This ain't good...
<0077> Nice.
<0078> Bonuses make me happy.
<0079> The one who wins the most stars wins OJ.
<0080> Stars obtained!
<0081> Oh no, oh no, oh no.
<0082> OMG, OMG, OMG!
<0083> Hm-m-mmm.
<0084> I don't like this!
<0085> Who the heck set the trap here!?
<0086> Heen!
<0087> What the heck, what the heck, what the heck.
<0088> Agyaah, this isn't great.
<0089> Doesn't it make you nervous when a boss appears?
<0090> Oh, here comes a big one.
<0091> Question is: should I beat it or run...?
<0092> Oh crap, a boss's here...!
<0093> I choose stars!
<0094> Stars it is!
<0095> Let's play a star-collecting game.
<0096> Given the circumstances, this is my choice!
<0097> Am I ready to fight battles?
<0098> Based on the current scenario, battle it is!
<0099> Alright, let's do some hand-to-hand combat.
<0100> You know what I like? Taking aggressive approaches.
<0101> 100% OJ Club, let's go!
<0102> Let me show you how well I play OJ.
<0103> Sure, let's play.
<0104> I can't wait to show off.
<0105> I'm thrilled.
<0106> I'll be the winner of the day.
<0107> Heheheh, I have a feeling that I'll come out on top.
<0108> Alright, I'm bringing a whirlwind of chaos to the board.
<0109> Yes!!!!! This is the strength of the 100% OJ Club!
<0110> What a tight match. That was fun!
<0111> Nothing's better than winning.
<0112> Poyo wins!!! Poyo wins!!!
<0113> Those moments when you get a new item are the best.
<0114> Well, let's see what we'll get.
<0115> Oh, what's this?
<0116> Wow, that's one of those things that make you happy.
<0117> Let's switch!
<0118> Now's the time to swap.
<0119> I'll let you take charge of this now.
<0120> It's your turn to shine.
<0121> Okay.
<0122> Good, good!
<0123> Alright!
<0124> Nope!
<0125> Ugh...
<0126> This is how lucky Poyo is!
<0127> Uh oh...
<0128> Let's go!
<0129> Yah!
<0130> You can do it!
<0131> Yahoooy!
<0132> Hmm?
<0133> That's nice.
<0134> That's super!
<0135> Man, this is annoying...!
<0136> I'm playing someone else's hyper card!
<0137> Hehe, here's a hyper card!
<0138> I'm turning the tables!
<0139> This is what will bring me victory!
<0140> I'm grateful! Thank you, thank you!
<0141> I'm gonna win this game, Chuu.
<0142> You got my back, Chuu.
<0149> Alright, let's get started with our club activity!
<0150> Oh, I'm fan of yours, Q!
<0151> Oh, it's Q!
<0152> I like your ears; we almost match!
<0153> N-not that I was distracted!
<0154> Oh boy, it's Ellie!
<0155> Hey, Ellie!
<0156> I know Ellie's also got animal ears.
<0157> I'd expect nothing less of the Season Two main character...
<0158> Will you look at how many stars I've got right now!
<0159> Looks like I'm headed for an overwhelming victory, doesn't it?
<0160> Everyone keeps falling before me. Could it be that my fists are just too strong?
