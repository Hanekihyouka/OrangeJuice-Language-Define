// ========= Scene:  Opening =========

// (No Speaker)
<0000> At Family Restaurant Pures

// (poyo)
<0001> *Munch munch*... Eating sure makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

// (chuu)
<0002> Huh?

// (poyo)
<0003> You eat three meals a day, and each of them always makes you super happy. I wonder why.

// (chuu)
<0004> Because food is one of humanity's three needs.

// (poyo)
<0005> Hey, Chuu, no dirty talk!

// (chuu)
<0006> That's not dirty.

// (chuu)
<0007> Well, let me ask you this: Isn't there anything you're interested in trying?

// (poyo)
<0008> I'd love to have a full-course meal at a certain fancy restaurant I can't afford...

// (chuu)
<0009> That's not what I meant. We're students, remember?

// (chuu)
<0010> Don't you wanna do something you can enjoy only while you're young?

// (poyo)
<0011> Dirty talk again!?

// (chuu)
<0012> What, are you going through puberty?!

// (poyo)
<0013> Yes, I am!

// (chuu)
<0014>Yeah, we both are... But, look, we've been students at our school for months now.

// (poyo)
<0015> That's true. So far, I've been having a good time. Studying's not so bad, and I like chatting and eating with friends like this.

// (poyo)
<0016> It'd be lying if I said I'm not enjoying my school life.

// (poyo)
<0017> But I feel like there's something missing.

// (chuu)
<0018> Same here. I wanna do something special! But...

// (poyo)
<0019> There's nothing that feels right. None of the school clubs look good.

// (chuu)
<0020> Man, our youth will waste away before we know it.

// (haruka)
<0021> Hey. What are you guys talking about?

// (kanata)
<0022> ......

// (poyo)
<0023> Oh, Haru-Kana.

// (chuu)
<0024> We're having a discussion on our student lives.

// (kanata)
<0025> ...You mean dirty talk?

// (chuu)
<0026> Not this again!

// (haruka)
<0027> I see. So you don't have anything particular you wanna do, huh.

// (poyo)
<0028> I do like the way my life is right now, but it feels lacking compared to those guys in the clubs.

// (kanata)
<0029> In my estimation, your period of youth is one-third as good as theirs.

// (poyo)
<0030> That's not good at all!

// (haruka)
<0031> How about yourself, Kanata?

// (kanata)
<0032> Pretty much the same as Poyo.

// (chuu)
<0033> So, no one's fully happy with their lives, huh.

// (haruka)
<0034> If you really don't like the way your life is, why don't you make it better yourself? â™¥

// (poyo)
<0035> I would if I could!

// (chuu)
<0036> Didn't you say a couple of minutes ago that eating makes you happy?

// (poyo)
<0037> And you started talking about our lives!

// (haruka)
<0038> Well, joining a club would be the best option... I guess.

// (poyo)
<0039> That's true, but... there's no club that interests me.

// (poyo)
<0040> I wish there was one all four of us could be fully committed to...

// (chuu)
<0041> We've been friends since kindergarten, so it'd be great if we could be in the same club.

// (haruka)
<0042> A club we can do together, huh. If we wanna do that...

// (chuu)
<0043> No sports, please.

// (kanata)
<0044> ...Agreed.

// (haruka)
<0045> I like sports. How about cooking?

// (poyo)
<0046> I don't cook. I only eat.

// (kanata)
<0047> Science.

// (haruka)
<0048> That'd make us smell like chemicals.

// (kanata)
<0049> You have the completely wrong idea, Haruka.

// (poyo)
<0050> We're done discussing!

// (poyo)
<0051> And we didn't reach a consensus! There's no club out there we can join together!

// (kanata)
<0052> I saw this coming the moment the discussion started.

// (chuu)
<0053> Leave it to the resident genius.

// (kanata)
<0054> Don't flatter me. You'll make me blush.

// (haruka)
<0055> I thought it'd be real fun if we could do something as a club activity. *Shuffle shuffle*

// (poyo)
<0056> Suddenly Haruka's shuffling a deck of playing cards.

// (haruka)
<0057> You all wanna play it, don't you? 100% Orange Juice, that is.

// (kanata)
<0058> I've been waiting.

// (chuu)
<0059> We're done talking, so it's good timing, I guess.

// (haruka)
<0060> Same rules as usual?

// (poyo)
<0061> Of course. The loser will buy the winner one thing on the menu.

// (chuu)
<0062> I've got to win.

// (kanata)
<0063> I'm in the mood for a thick steak.

// (haruka)
<0064> Let's get started, then.

// (poyo)
<0065> 100% Orange Juice, let's go!


// ========= Scene:  Ending =========


// (poyo)
<0066> Yay, I won!!!

// (chuu)
<0067> Dang it. I'm pretty sure I used my cards at the right times.

// (kanata)
<0068> You can't win with skill alone in 100% Orange Juice.

// (haruka)
<0069> Ugh, I'm the loser... and I'm already low on money.

// (kanata)
<0070> Because you waste your money.

// (haruka)
<0071> A little help, Kana?

// (kanata)
<0072> No.

// (haruka)
<0073> You're so mean...

// (chuu)
<0074> Well, I guess we can call this a good page from the book of our youth.

// (poyo)
<0075> I know, right?

// (chuu)
<0076> ?

// (poyo)
<0077> You know when I feel like I'm enjoying my youth the most? It's when I hang out with you guys.

// (kanata)
<0078> If each of our lives is 33% as good as other people's, it'll be 132% as good when combined.

// (chuu)
<0079> Is that how it works? Are you sure?

// (poyo)
<0080> I don't think that's wrong, because we're actually having fun!

// (haruka)
<0081> Yeah.

// (haruka)
<0082> After we all land jobs and stuff, we won't get to play a board game in a restaurant like this anymore.

// (haruka)
<0083> So I think this is our way to make the most of our youth.

// (poyo)
<0084> I'm gonna cry.

// (chuu)
<0085> Well said, Haru... What you just said has already improved my perception on life.

// (kanata)
<0086> By my calculation, it's 150% as good now.

// (haruka)
<0087> So, this means we don't have to join a school club to make our student lives better? 

// (chuu)
<0088> I guess so.

// (poyo)
<0089> No, we should do a club!

// (haruka)
<0090> Huh?

// (poyo)
<0091> With all of us together, we can make our lives much better and more fun, so we should do some club activity!

// (chuu)
<0092> But we decided there's no clubs for us to join.

// (kanata)
<0093> Then we'll just have to make one.

// (poyo)
<0094> Yeah! We'll make one! A new club!

// (haruka)
<0095> And what do we do there?

// (kanata)
<0096> You should've figured it out by now.

// (chuu)
<0097> Well, it's very easy to guess... isn't it?

// (haruka)
<0098> Ah, I get it.

// (poyo)
<0099> We're making a 100% OJ club at our Shiny Sparkling Academy!!!
