<0000> There.
<0001> Off you go.
<0002> Yah!
<0003> I'm throwin' this!
<0004> Here's a card!
<0005> I'm gonna play this! How's that!
<0006> I'm gonna use this, alright?
<0007> Can't wait to see what'll happen.
<0008> Are we gonna set a trap here?
<0009> Am I doing this right?
<0010> Hmm, probably something like this.
<0011> Here's a trap card.
<0012> Here's a battle card.
<0013> I'm strong enough even without this! I'll still use it, though!
<0014> This card makes you stronger!? That's awesome!
<0015> I'm gonna play this! I'm sure it'll give me so much power!
<0016> Awooo! Beasts, lend me your power!
<0017> I messed up so hard...
<0018> I'm so not done yet...!
<0019> I can do this more!
<0020> Alright, I'm done taking a break!
<0021> Are you kidding me!?
<0022> Oh no, I thought I'd get back up.
<0023> What have I done...
<0024> Ugh. Not yet? Not yet?
<0025> Ey!
<0026> Oryah!
<0027> Tey!
<0028> You little!
<0029> Ouch!
<0030> Owah!
<0031> C'mon!
<0032> Dang it!
<0033> Alright, I'm full of energy now.
<0034> This feels so good, I might fall asleep.
<0035> I'm much better now.
<0036> Never been better.
<0037> Owaaah!
<0038> What gives?
<0039> Muwaaah!
<0040> Spinning... spinning!
<0041> Youuu gooot meee...
<0042> I should've been more alert...
<0043> I can't keep standing...
<0044> I'm gonna take a little break here...
<0045> You fight me now!
<0046> Rawr!
<0047> This is what the Beast Witch can do.
<0048> Meow! I want you to play with me!
<0049> You wanna play with me? Sure!
<0050> Alright, bring it on.
<0051> You made a mistake to challenge the Beast Witch.
<0052> I'll make you regret this!
<0053> Tail attack!
<0054> I'm gonna hit you with my tail!
<0055> How's that!
<0056> Take this! Yah!
<0057> Kyua!
<0058> What are you doing!?
<0059> Uh oh.
<0060> Ohaah!
<0061> That hurt a lot!
<0062> Why would you do that!?
<0063> What did I do to you!?
<0064> I hate getting hurt!
<0065> That'd never hit me.
<0066> Check out my quick moves!
<0067> Ku-ku-ku, I'm too fast to see, aren't I!
<0068> You're shockingly slow.
<0069> That was an easy win.
<0070> I had a fun time.
<0071> You done for already?
<0072> *Sigh*... I wanted to have more fun.
<0073> Ugyaah! I got beaten!
<0074> I can't believe someone like that beat me.
<0075> I'll defeat you next time...
<0076> Ugyaah.
<0077> Ugyaah, I got a bunch of these.
<0078> Just how many did I get!? Might be too many to count.
<0079> I feel so good!
<0080> I want more! More, I say!
<0081> Hold on! Those are mine...!
<0082> Nobody told me about this! Wait up!
<0083> Huh? Where'd my stars go?
<0084> My savings...!!!
<0085> This has gotta be the work of dastardly humans...!
<0086> Ugyah! My tail's stuck on it!
<0087> Stupid trap...! Dang it...!
<0088> Can't believe I fell for this... Muuh..!
<0089> Oh, look at that huge beast!
<0090> Fu-fu-fu! This is something else!
<0091> What a beast! Wahaha! I won't miss this chance!
<0092> Alright, I'll make this quick!
<0093> I'll go get myself a bunch of stars! *Punch punch*!
<0094> The more stars, the better, right?
<0095> I'm gonna get more and more of these!
<0096> I'm very good at finding this kind of stuff.
<0097> I'll show you all what the instinct of a beast can do.
<0098> I'll go wild now!
<0099> Rawr rawr! I'm gonna fight!
<0100> My tail is getting real impatient!
<0101> I'm Teotoratta! The Beast Witch!
<0102> I've been waiting for you! We're gonna go play now!
<0103> You wanna see how strong I am? Alright, follow me!
<0104> My turn? I was sick and tired of waiting!
<0105> I'm more than ready! Let's do this!
<0106> Oh yeah! Let's do this!
<0107> I'm so pumped up! Awooo!
<0108> I'm good to go! Bring it on!
<0109> Awoooooo! I won! I won!
<0110> I'm number one! Impressive, isn't it?
<0111> Hey, did you see how well I played?
<0112> Uhihi! I'm sooo happyyy!
<0113> Look what I just got. You want it?
<0114> Bow wow! I found this! Be happy!
<0115> Oh, is that an item you got there? Wanna play with it now?
<0116> You want this thing? You've got to praise me first!
<0117> Take my place!
<0118> It's time for you go out there.
<0119> Switch with me for a bit.
<0120> I need a break. You got this.
<0121> Okay.
<0122> Way to go!
<0123> Bow wow!
<0124> No.
<0125> How disappointing.
<0126> So lucky! So happy!
<0127> What the heck is this?
<0128> Let's get started!
<0129> Dice roll time.
<0130> Here we go!
<0131> Yoo-hoo.
<0132> *Whimper*
<0133> Well done!
<0134> That's amazing! I praise you!
<0135> *Whimper whimper*
<0136> Should I use this? Will it help?
<0137> *Sniff sniff*... This smells good! I'm using it!
<0138> I'm just gonna use this and see how it'll turn out!
<0139> What's gonna happen? I'm stoked!
<0140> Miusaki! Awooo! Get ready to fight me!
<0141> I'm not on a rampage. I'm just playing!
<0142> Miusakiii, you done for already!?
<0143> *Whimper*... Miusakiii, don't leave me alone.
<0144> What are you? Beast? Human?
<0145> Oh, huh? A human? A beast? Which are you!?
<0146> So you were a beast! No way could you beat the Beast Witch!
<0147> My power didn't work on you... So you were a human...
<0148> Alright, great work, my beasts.
<0149> Way to go, my fellow beasts!
<0150> You guys did a super good job! I can't hold this much...!
<0151> Here, I can use my power to its fullest extent...!
<0152> I can sense beasts everywhere around here.
<0153> Fufufu, I like it here.
<0154> Awooo! Bow wow!
<0155> My magic isn't working on that thing...?
<0156> What in the!? Am I not the only Beast Witch around?
<0157> Hmm? There's something funny going on around here...
<0158> This is confusing. What the heck's going on here?
<0159> So, there's more than one of me? Does anything go around here!?
