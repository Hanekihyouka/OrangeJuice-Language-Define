<0000> Halena! Halena! Cook finally managed to catch up to you!
// (halena)
<0001> We agreed to meet here, didn't we? But you're quite late. Did something happen on the way?
// (cook)
<0002> Cook knew you'd know she wasn't just loafing off! Something very weird is happening!
// (halena)
<0003> It feels like a lot of weird things happen around this area.
// (cook)
<0004> Listen! A whole bunch of people started following Cook as soon as she came back to town!
// (cook)
<0005> They all had knives and forks in their hands! It was super scary!
// (halena)
<0006> Whoa!? Were you hurt?
// (cook)
<0007> No. Cook managed to give them the run around for a while.
// (cook)
<0008> But then she got tired, and they came closer and closer... Cook thought she was done for!
// (cook)
<0009> But then...
// (halena)
<0010> Please don't put a suspenseful pause after a sentence like that. I really am worried, you know!
// (cook)
<0011> Fweehee. But then, they all lined up politely behind Cook in an orderly queue!
// (cook)
<0012> So she asked them, "Huh? Didn't you want to eat me?"
// (halena)
<0013> And?
// (cook)
<0014> They said "No! Who would ever eat the Mythical Red Rooster?!"
// (cook)
<0015> How rude! Do they even know what a rooster is?! Hmph!
// (halena)
<0016> Well, putting that aside, I think I know what's going on.
// (cook)
<0017> You do?! From just that?
// (halena)
<0018> There's been a rumor flying around town lately about an amazing food critic.
// (cook)
<0019> Cook doesn't see how that's relevant.
// (halena)
<0020> She doesn't write reviews or anything, but if you follow her, you're guaranteed to find a good meal.
// (cook)
<0021> Whoa?! Cook needs to find her and follow her, then!
// (halena)
<0022> That's... probably not possible.
// (halena)
<0023> Cook, you go for food every time you come back after a flight, right?
// (cook)
<0024> Of course! Flying is hungry work.
// (halena)
<0025> And you know where all the best restaurants are, and all of their daily specials.
// (cook)
<0026> Cook's ability to find her next meal is second to none!
// (halena)
<0027> You're pretty visible up in the sky.
// (halena)
<0028> I bet they see you flying in, and then wherever you land has better food for cheaper than usual, so...
// (cook)
<0029> In other words...
// (halena)
<0030> In other words...
// (cook)
<0031> Cheep! Cook's become a food critic without even realizing it?!
// (cook)
<0032> And she's been giving out free advertising this whole time?!
// (halena)
<0033> Ahaha. I think that's probably true.
// (cook)
<0034> It's gross to have so many people watching Cook eat though. There's only one thing to do!
// (halena)
<0035> Oh?
// (cook)
<0036> Cook's gonna find one of those hidden gem, hole in the wall places nobody knows about and eat there!
// (halena)
<0037> That's exactly what a food critic would say.
// (halena)
<0038> Is this what they call a "class change?"
