<0003> There.
<0004> I'm gonna play a card.
<0005> There we go!
<0006> Cards, no biggie.
<0007> Alright, I'll go with this one.
<0008> Ku-ku-ku.
<0009> Let me set a little something down here...
<0010> This is gonna be fun.
<0011> Here, a trap.
<0012> Kuhihi.
<0013> Get ready for this.
<0014> I'll go wild.
<0015> Eat this!
<0016> Fuhahahaha! Fear me!
<0017> Ohh yeah!
<0018> Guess it's about time to get going again.
<0019> Well, I'm done resting on my laurels.
<0020> This game ain't over yet.
<0021> What the? For real?
<0022> Aaaargh?
<0023> You gotta be kidding me.
<0024> This sucks so hard.
<0025> There!
<0026> Shaah!
<0027> Atah!
<0028> Uryah!
<0029> Gya!
<0030> Not bad.
<0031> Dammit!
<0032> Ugh!
<0033> That's a big help.
<0034> Oh, I like this.
<0035> That feels so good.
<0036> This is great.
<0037> Howah!?
<0038> Owawah.
<0039> Meow!
<0040> What the heck's happening!
<0041> Gooo!
<0042> No way...
<0043> How could this happen to me?
<0044> Ugu-ugu...
<0045> Fuhahaha!
<0046> Here I come!
<0047> Found ya!
<0048> Come fight me!
<0049> Reckless is what you are.
<0050> Oh, you want a piece of me?
<0051> Alright, try and beat me.
<0052> I can't believe you'd want to pick a fight with me...
<0053> Ora!
<0054> Take that!
<0055> Sey!
<0056> Yah!
<0057> Ow!
<0058> Ouch!
<0059> Koooo!
<0060> That smarts...!
<0061> Gyaaa!
<0062> Guwaah!
<0063> Hey jerk, what the heck's your deal!?
<0064> Bueeeeh!
<0065> Behold my agility!
<0066> That was so easy to dodge.
<0067> Hoh.
<0068> Hmph, slowpoke.
<0069> This is how it always turns out.
<0070> That wasn't worth talking about.
<0071> I expected you to do a little better than this.
<0072> So weak.
<0073> What... the...
<0074> I lost...
<0075> I should've been more careful...!
<0076> I don't believe this...
<0077> Alright, these are mine.
<0078> I'm taking these.
<0079> I'll gratefully accept these.
<0080> What a nice surprise.
<0081> Hey, wait up!
<0082> Crap, I screwed up.
<0083> This is ridiculous.
<0084> Oh shoot!
<0085> You little...!
<0086> W-why the heck did it have to be here!?
<0087> Who the heck put this thing here!?
<0088> Goddammit!
<0089> I like this vibe.
<0090> Part of me thinks this is gonna be fun.
<0091> Things are getting real savage around here.
<0092> Here it comes.
<0093> I'll go make every star in the whole world mine.
<0094> I'm gonna make myself super rich.
<0095> Kukuku, money makes the world go 'round.
<0096> I'll get myself a ton...
<0097> You guys are all gonna kneel down before my powers.
<0098> Strength is all that matters.
<0099> I'm itching for a fight.
<0100> I'll go make war.
<0101> You tough enough to follow me?
<0102> Alright then, let's get moving.
<0103> Well then, what should I do to tease them?
<0104> This game's gonna be about having fun, okay?
<0105> The game's begun.
<0106> Kukuku, I'll be the winner.
<0107> Okay, let's do this.
<0108> It'll be so easy for me to win this game.
<0109> Well, this is no surprise.
<0110> You guys all work for me now.
<0111> What an easy win, fufufu.
<0112> Kukuku, just as I planned.
<0113> Oh, that looks real good.
<0114> We got the best thing!
<0115> That's ours now!
<0116> Oooooh!
<0117> Mind taking it from here for me?
<0118> Alright, it's your turn to go.
<0119> You can deal with the rest, okay?
<0120> Good luck out there.
<0121> Okay.
<0122> Wow.
<0123> Alright!
<0124> No!
<0125> What the heck?
<0126> Today's my lucky day.
<0127> What the heck~?
<0128> Let's get going.
<0129> Here it rolls.
<0130> Go go!
<0131> Yo!
<0132> Ngaah?
<0133> Oh, good job.
<0134> You exceeded my expectations. Well done.
<0135> Son of a bench!
<0136> I don't even know what this one does!
<0137> Your skill's mine now!
<0138> This is not mine, but that doesn't matter!
<0139> Never seen a card like this!
<0140> Cheers.
<0141> Q... Who the heck are you!?
<0142> You... are a guy now?
<0143> W-what was this guy's deal?
<0144> I was so confused...
<0145> Kukuku! Now I've got control of the game!
<0146> You guys got nowhere to run now!
<0147> This is what I'm capable of!
<0148> Fufufu, you guys better run for your lives.
<0149> I smell so many dogs around here...
<0150> You clearly look like a villain.
<0151> Ugh, you look like big trouble.
<0152> Now we both know which one's the better villain.
<0153> Ugh, you weird stranger...
<0154> You piece of junk!
<0155> You betrayed me!?
<0156> You're gonna keep working for me, you got that?
<0157> S-servant rebellion...
<0158> You're gonna be my food.
<0159> Oh, this is actually interesting.
<0160> Time for a rat hunt.
