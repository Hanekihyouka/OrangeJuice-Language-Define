<0000> Po.
<0001> Poppo.
<0002> Poppopo.
<0003> Poppooh.
<0004> Time to po-lay a card.
<0005> Here.
<0006> About time to make a move.
<0007> Here poes.
<0008> Trap here.
<0009> Mother's putting something down here.
<0010> Fufu.
<0011> This here looks like a good po-lace for a trap.
<0012> You won't leave in one piece.
<0013> You can't expect any mercy from Mother.
<0014> This is going to be rough.
<0015> Let's see if you can make it through this.
<0016> Mother will keep standing no matter what happens. 
<0017> That was a good rest.
<0018> An occasional po-reak is great.
<0019> Resting is done.
<0020> Mother feels refreshed.
<0021> Can Mother extend her po-reak?
<0022> Poh dear...
<0023> This is going to affect my po-lans.
<0024> *Yawn* This means Mother gets to rest a little longer.
<0025> Mother's going on the poffensive.
<0026> Mother'll unleash her fists now.
<0027> Here's Mother's love for you.
<0028> Take Mother's attack.
<0029> That hurts.
<0030> How could you?
<0031> Ugh.
<0032> Goodness.
<0033> Talk about healing.
<0034> Mother heals herself whenever she can.
<0035> Mother can't afford to po down here.
<0036> Mother feels alive again.
<0037> Between time and space...
<0038> Mother simultaneously exists and does not exist.
<0039> Mother is the universe.
<0040> As far as this can take Mother...
<0041> Oh no...
<0042> Mother's feet are not working.
<0043> Maybe Mother's done for.
<0044> Mother doesn't have time to be lying down.
<0045> Mother's being very aggressive.
<0046> Mother sometimes chooses violence...
<0047> Mother'll present her power to you...
<0048> No one can get in Mother's way.
<0049> Violence is a no-po.
<0050> Poh dear, your eyes look terrifying.
<0051> Are you sure you have to do this?
<0052> Are you willing to fight Mother?
<0053> A grown-up shouldn't po all out.
<0054> Here's a sharp jab for you.
<0055> Sometimes pain teaches you a lesson.
<0056> This is love.
<0057> Mother felt that one.
<0058> Fufu, that's adorable.
<0059> That was a good one.
<0060> Popo!
<0061> Mother might not last much longer.
<0062> This is a little more than Mother can take.
<0063> Did you try to kill Mother...?
<0064> Mother doesn't cry easily, but tears are coming out of her eyes.
<0065> Was there a breeze just now?
<0066> Fufu, a miss.
<0067> Behold Mother's elegant move.
<0068> Mother's no longer there.
<0069> This ends your ponishment.
<0070> Fufu, now you know how strong Mother is.
<0071> Sit and reflect on what you have done, pokay?
<0072> This is how an adult does it.
<0073> This can't be happening.
<0074> How dare you strike Mother down?
<0075> Maybe Mother raised you wrong?
<0076> Mother's suffering.
<0077> These should help Mother handle her household finances...
<0078> Unexpected cash always makes Mother happy.
<0079> Much appreciated.
<0080> You'll learn the true value of money when you're a grown-uppo.
<0081> This loss could destroy Mother's family.
<0082> We can't live without money.
<0083> There's nothing that feels worse than this.
<0084> Poh my goodness. Mother's getting all teary-eyed.
<0085> Why would anyone entrap Mother?
<0086> How cunning... Well played.
<0087> Poh no you didn't.
<0088> Shoot... I was too tall to see what was around my feet.
<0089> Engaging with that thing has to be very risky.
<0090> Phew, seems like things are different around here now.
<0091> This is surprising...
<0092> Poh dear, it feels like things are about to get rough around here.
<0093> Money is important.
<0094> Mother wants to save up more.
<0095> Having a lot of money makes Mother feel safe and secure.
<0096> Mother would like some stars, please.
<0097> Mother needs to let off some steam.
<0098> Mother's fists are aching for a fight.
<0099> Mother shouldn't be getting physical... but.
<0100> Where can Mother find a good ponching bag?
<0101> Did you miss Mother?
<0102> Mother Poppo here.
<0103> Fufu, you can depend on me.
<0104> You are saying Mother still looks pretty?
<0105> It's begun now.
<0106> This is the game Mother's most familiar with.
<0107> Fufu, let's have some fun, everyone.
<0108> Another battle is about to start...
<0109> Mother of victory.
<0110> No one can beat the smile of Mother.
<0111> It's absurd to even think about beating Mother.
<0112> Poppo. This simply makes Mother happy.
<0113> Don't blow all your money, pokay?
<0114> Didn't you buy the same thing before... What? It's not the same?
<0115> Look how happy you look... like a little child.
<0116> Mother's glad for you.
<0117> Take over for Mother, now.
<0118> Now we're gonna switch.
<0119> Change places with Mother now.
<0120> Help Mother out, okay?
<0121> Pokay.
<0122> Good.
<0123> Yes.
<0124> No.
<0125> Poh dear...
<0126> You're very fortunate.
<0127> Mother's a bit flustered.
<0128> Let's po.
<0129> Poh!
<0130> Mother's rooting for you.
<0131> How do you do?
<0132> Popopo?
<0133> Well done.
<0134> Let Mother praise you.
<0135> Hmpoh!
<0136> Using someone else's card is also a good strategy.
<0137> Mother borrowed a Hyper card.
<0138> It'd be rude if Mother used this power of someone else thoughtlessly.
<0139> Mother'll thankfully play this card.
<0140> Thank you.
<0141> Mother's love turns even violence to stars.
<0142> Poh boy, you're such a naughty child.
<0143> You being so full of energy makes Mother happy.
<0144> This is very heartwarming.
<0145> You all have given Mother so much energy.
<0146> Fufufu, nothing's better than being peppy.
<0147> Boy, the power of love has healed Mother.
<0148> Mother's happy, surrounded by lively kids.
<0149> You must lose something to gain something...
<0150> *Pant pant*... Mother's too old for this.
<0151> Warps were easier for Mother when she was a little girl... They're a bit tough now.
<0152> M-Mother's legs are shaking.
<0153> This is a waste of resources...
<0154> Don't wanna do this... but...
<0155> Ugh... Can't hold any more cards.
<0156> Even Mother's love can't help out with this.
<0157> Mother's gonna see... how strong her daughter is.
<0158> Fufufu, let's play.
<0159> Mother's so happy to see you're doing great.
<0160> A child surpassing their parent... Mother's delighted.
<0161> This card takes Mother back.
