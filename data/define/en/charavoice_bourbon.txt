<0000> Here!
<0001> There!
<0002> Mm!
<0003> Hoo!
<0004> Let's up the ante.
<0005> I'll make things more interesting.
<0006> You gotta let loose once in a while.
<0007> This seems like fun.
<0008> How about we use our brain a bit?
<0009> I'm not above a little fighting dirty.
<0010> Gyahaha!
<0011> I wonder if someone will pick up my present.
<0012> Never hesitate!
<0013> Let's even the odds a bit.
<0014> Ha!
<0015> Time for my secret weapon!
<0016> It's about time to set things in motion.
<0017> Howaah... That was a good nap.
<0018> Hrm... let's not do that again.
<0019> Time to get up.
<0020> Can't catch a moment's rest...
<0021> The engine just won't start...
<0022> This looks like it could take a while.
<0023> Well, let's take it easy for now.
<0024> I'll relax for a bit.
<0025> Hoh!
<0026> Fire away!
<0027> Haa!
<0028> I'll take you down.
<0029> Tch.
<0030> Mm... A small scratch.
<0031> Bah.
<0032> Oof.
<0033> Ahh, such bliss.
<0034> I can feel my shoulders relaxing.
<0035> How refreshing.
<0036> Ohhh...
<0037> I'm being blown off course!
<0038> Where are we going?
<0039> Destination seems... unknown.
<0040> O-oooh...?
<0041> Falling down!
<0042> Goodnight.
<0043> It's time for a break.
<0044> Time to kick back and take it easy.
<0045> To battle!
<0046> You're not going anywhere.
<0047> All guns at the ready!
<0048> My job is to stop you.
<0049> A one-on-one? Very good.
<0050> Challenge accepted.
<0051> Hm?
<0052> Are you sure?
<0053> Hey hey!
<0054> I'd recommend dodging this.
<0055> Ho!
<0056> Turrets, fire!
<0057> Hnngh.
<0058> Just a scratch.
<0059> Owie!
<0060> Mm... I felt that one.
<0061> Ugoh!
<0062> Bwuoh!
<0063> Ouch ouch ouch... that smarts!
<0064> Whoa, that stung!
<0065> Ha ha, I've still got it.
<0066> A close shave!
<0067> ...Hm? Something just flew past?
<0068> Dodged by a hair's breadth.
<0069> Easy does it.
<0070> Better luck next time.
<0071> I did my job.
<0072> Rest in peace.
<0073> You're tough...
<0074> Man, to think I'd be stopped here...
<0075> Rest in peace... me.
<0076> Man down!
<0077> How joyful!
<0078> Bwahaha, that's what I'm talking about!
<0079> Oooh, a great haul!
<0080> This makes me happy.
<0081> Ah-hah... that stings.
<0082> My hopes and dreams...!
<0083> The stars... they're so far away...
<0084> Oh damn!
<0085> It was a trap!
<0086> Man, I fell for it!
<0087> Bwahaha, that was a good one.
<0088> Man, but I got careless.
<0089> Hahaha, now this one seems worth fighting.
<0090> Oooh... I'm getting goosebumps.
<0091> Tch... I thought there weren't supposed to be any real threats around? Balderdash.
<0092> Do such monsters fly in the sky...?
<0093> Let's take our time and enjoy the starry sky.
<0094> I hear the call of the stars.
<0095> You should appreciate the small things in life.
<0096> I'll seek out the stars.
<0097> Hrm... Should I get a bit into it?
<0098> Sometimes there's no choice but to fight.
<0099> Here's hoping for a good challenge.
<0100> I have a feeling there's fighting to be had.
<0101> I'm no one important, but looking forward to working with you.
<0102> You're choosing an old fella like me?
<0103> Let's do our best together.
<0104> I'll help you reach the goal you're working toward.
<0105> Let's do this our own way.
<0106> I'll take my time and assess the situation first.
<0107> To victory!
<0108> It's a beautiful day for a flight.
<0109> Looks like it's my lucky day.
<0110> It is done.
<0111> Hrm. All's well that ends well, eh?
<0112> This calls for a victory toast!
<0113> Congratulations.
<0114> Hey, good for you.
<0115> That's a nice find right there.
<0116> Oo... what's that one do?
<0117> Gotcha.
<0118> Isn't that something!
<0119> Copy.
<0120> As if!
<0121> What a shame.
<0122> Haha, lady luck smiles on you.
<0123> What's that?
<0124> Let's get going.
<0125> Let's throw.
<0126> Go!
<0127> A fine day to you.
<0128> Well well.
<0129> Good.
<0130> Ooh! Amazing!
<0131> Blast it!
<0132> I've got my connections.
<0133> What's there to hesitate about?
<0134> Let's gamble on this.
<0135> What could this do, I wonder...?
<0136> Cheers!
<0137> Hmh. Let me take over from here.
<0138> Looks like you could use some help.
<0139> Mm... Leave this to me.
<0140> Let me take care of this.
<0141> No hard feelings lady, but you're in the way.
<0142> What can I do for you, lady?
<0143> Not bad for one so young.
<0144> Man, you totally got me... what a girl.
<0145> I've come to meddle again, chief.
<0146> Man, you work me too hard.
<0147> Ha, the drinks are on you tonight!
<0148> Gunyunyu... fine, I'll open that bottle I was saving.
<0149> Still a stick in the mud, eh chief.
<0150> Oh? It's rare to see you so worked up, chief.
<0151> Ha ha ha, just sit down and take it easy for a while.
<0152> Well, this sort of thing happens too.
<0153> Geez. That's not the way to go, kid.
<0154> Oh. You like whales, kiddo?
<0155> Looks like you're fighting a hard battle.
<0156> Got anything good for me today?
