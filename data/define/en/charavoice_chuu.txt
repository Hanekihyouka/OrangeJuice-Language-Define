<0000> Here goes nothing.
<0001> Here goes the roll.
<0002> Dice, give me something good.
<0003> The real game begins now.
<0004> I think this one will work out the best in this situation.
<0005> I should play a card now.
<0006> Hmm, this one should work.
<0007> This one, maybe?
<0008> Setting a trap here.
<0009> This might spell disaster to someone later.
<0010> Time to set a trap.
<0011> Hmm, should I put this down here?
<0012> Let's play this card, just to be safe.
<0013> I'm gonna win the fight with this card.
<0014> Alright, I'll play this card to take advantage.
<0015> Let's see how this card will help.
<0016> Okay, I think it's time to do this.
<0017> I thought I'd have to stay down.
<0018> Geez, I'm glad I'm back up again.
<0019> I'm not in the best position... but I guess it'll work out somehow.
<0020> Alright, I'm back in action. I can still turn this game around.
<0021> Ugh, this doesn't feel good.
<0022> I'm heading down a dangerous path.
<0023> Seriously...? Tsk.
<0024> Oh man, I screwed up?
<0025> I think I'll go on the offensive.
<0026> I'm gonna get aggressive, okay?
<0027> I'll strike first and prevent you from attacking me.
<0028> You need to be prepared for a bit of hurt.
<0029> Oops.
<0030> That hurts!
<0031> Oh, come on.
<0032> I messed up.
<0033> Healing is crucial.
<0034> Alright, I guess I'm much better now?
<0035> The damage from earlier is all gone.
<0036> I think I've recovered enough to go wild?
<0037> Okay, it's a warp.
<0038> Oops, where will I end up at?
<0039> Oh, whoa.
<0040> Where I end up will decide my situation...
<0041> Damn it, this sucks!
<0042> Are you kidding me!!!
<0043> Aaaaaaaah!!!
<0044> Is my playing style responsible for this KO...?
<0045> Accept my challenge!
<0046> I'm gonna knock you down.
<0047> Time for a fist fight!
<0048> It's the moment to strike!
<0049> Wow, I didn't see that challenge coming.
<0050> Okay, I'll figure something out.
<0051> Oh, you're bursting with energy, aren't you?
<0052> Looks like you're ready to fight!
<0053> Ora!
<0054> You little!
<0055> Go down!
<0056> Drop dead!
<0057> Goh!
<0058> Uge.
<0059> Tsk.
<0060> Not a big deal, but...
<0061> Wait a second.
<0062> That's not fair...
<0063> You could've gone easy on me.
<0064> Goddammit!
<0065> I was almost hit.
<0066> No damage taken.
<0067> I can't afford to take any damage.
<0068> That gave me the chills.
<0069> Hah-hah-hah!
<0070> Thought you'd beat me?
<0071> You're pathetically weak... Oh, sorry for the harsh words.
<0072> Man, things are looking up for me! ...Am I getting a little too hyped?
<0073> Damn it!!!
<0074> Oh, for crying out loud!
<0075> Why am I even doing this!?
<0076> Oh, seriously!?
<0077> Alright, stars obtained.
<0078> You need stars, no matter what you do.
<0079> Alright, this is great.
<0080> I'm taking these.
<0081> Oh...
<0082> Knock it off, will you?
<0083> That was a big financial hit.
<0084> Man, it just went south for me.
<0085> And I walked right into a trap.
<0086> No, cut it out!
<0087> No, a whole lot of noes.
<0088> Ugh, a trap?
<0089> I have to be even more cautious now.
<0090> Oh man, a boss is here now.
<0091> Here comes a boss. What will that change, I wonder.
<0092> Why don't you go beat another player?
<0093> Guess I'll go gathering stars.
<0094> I'll go with stars.
<0095> I might as well get myself more stars.
<0096> I'm set to collect stars.
<0097> Battles... I'm gonna have to try not to get too excited.
<0098> Well, battles make my adrenaline surge.
<0099> Relax, Chuu. You don't want to become the kind of person who seeks out fights.
<0100> Uh, I hate to admit this, but.. I feel like there's a part of me that craves fights.
<0101> Call me Chuu.
<0102> Oh, wanna play a match? Definitely.
<0103> I had nothing to do. Good timing.
<0104> I can get excited easily. Don't let it put you off, okay?
<0105> I don't do well with luck-based games, but...
<0106> I use strats to achieve my wins.
<0107> Alright, where do I begin?
<0108> Let's do this.
<0109> I won. Fufu.
<0110> I might've gotten a little excited.
<0111> HECK YEAH! Oh, sorry I got loud.
<0112> Looks like my plans worked out perfectly...
<0113> Let me see.
<0114> Got a new thing?
<0115> I feel like we got something good...
<0116> Oh, what's that?
<0117> Let's switch.
<0118> I think it's time for a player change.
<0119> I need to get some rest. It's in your hands now.
<0120> Nice to team up with you.
<0121> OK.
<0122> Oh.
<0123> I got this.
<0124> No.
<0125> Tsk, man.
<0126> I got lucky.
<0127> What... Huh?
<0128> Alright!
<0129> Let's go.
<0130> Good luck.
<0131> Yo.
<0132> Um.
<0133> Well done.
<0134> That's amazing.
<0135> Aaaaaaaah!!! Goddammit!
<0136> Here's a card that I snatched.
<0137> Not quite sure when I should play this one, but I guess the time is now.
<0138> Not that I use this card a lot, but I think it'll help.
<0139> Let me use someone else's Hyper card.
<0140> Thanks.
<0141> Gotta keep an eye on Poyo's luck.
<0142> I'm counting on you to draw good cards.
<0149> Playing with the usual members is such a relief.
<0150> Marc and I look a little bit alike, don't we?
<0151> Oh, I thought you were me.
<0152> Flying in a plane is something I wanna experience for once.
<0153> Airplanes and rockets do seem quite formidable...
<0154> Chris, thanks for your excellent service at the restaurant.
<0155> Chris!?
<0156> It feels kind of awkward to beat an acquaintance...
<0157> You didn't go easy on me at all...
<0158> You went a little too far, Chuu. You gotta watch it.
<0159> That's not like you at all, Chuu. Calm down.
<0160> This isn't good. This kind of excitement isn't good.
