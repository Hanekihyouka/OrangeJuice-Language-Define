<0000> All right.
<0001> What will I get?
<0002> Off I go.
<0003> Give me a good one.
<0004> I'll just use this one.
<0005> It's time to play a card.
<0006> I'll turn the tables.
<0007> I'm using this.
<0008> It's trap time.
<0009> I'm setting this here.
<0010> I guess this is a good spot.
<0011> Here, a trap.
<0012> I know it's childish if I do this, but...
<0013> There won't even be a bone left to bury.
<0014> I'll smash you down.
<0015> Let me finish you off.
<0016> For the future of my toy store!
<0017> Ugh...
<0018> I can't waste my time sleeping.
<0019> I'll make up for lost time.
<0020> At last...
<0021> Damn...
<0022> Crap...
<0023> I'm disappointed in myself.
<0024> Age is taking its toll on me.
<0025> Hah!
<0026> Go down!
<0027> I'll crush you!
<0028> Urah!
<0029> Gah.
<0030> Ugh.
<0031> Nuh.
<0032> Ow.
<0033> Phew...
<0034> The wounds are gone.
<0035> Okay, I can keep going.
<0036> The game goes on!
<0037> Hmm.
<0038> Where am I going?
<0039> Where am I?
<0040> I'm warping?
<0041> I feel miserable.
<0042> Tsk.
<0043> I could've done better.
<0044> Ah...
<0045> Fight me!
<0046> Let's get the job done.
<0047> Are you opposing me?
<0048> Are you ready to get beaten?
<0049> Out of my way!
<0050> I guess fighting is the only choice.
<0051> Whatever happens, don't blame me.
<0052> You're paying the price for this.
<0053> Dah!
<0054> Take this!
<0055> Hah!
<0056> You're going down.
<0057> Oww.
<0058> Guh.
<0059> You're good.
<0060> Ugh.
<0061> What the?
<0062> You're better than I thought.
<0063> I'm impressed.
<0064> Guoooh!
<0065> It won't reach me.
<0066> Not good enough.
<0067> Hmph.
<0068> Where did you aim at?
<0069> I must win.
<0070> I can't afford to lose.
<0071> You can sleep down there.
<0072> Loser.
<0073> Not like this...
<0074> Son of a...
<0075> You've gotta be kidding me...
<0076> ......
<0077> More.
<0078> I have to get myself more of these.
<0079> Gimme much more.
<0080> I need to gather more of these.
<0081> I can't afford to lose any of these.
<0082> They dropped out of my hands.
<0083> My stars.
<0084> Damn it.
<0085> Oh shoot!
<0086> Someone got me.
<0087> A trap, huh.
<0088> Something just happened.
<0089> That guy looks hard to beat.
<0090> Let the grown up handle this.
<0091> This is going to be challenging.
<0092> Here comes a big guy.
<0093> I'll go for stars.
<0094> I choose to get stars.
<0095> Anyway, I'll gather these.
<0096> What I need is stars.
<0097> Looks like I need to get some people out of my way.
<0098> I'll knock everyone down.
<0099> I'll beat every last one of my opponents.
<0100> I'm gonna defeat all of you.
<0101> Arthur here.
<0102> For the future's sake.
<0103> I'll get my hands on victory.
<0104> Let's do this together.
<0105> So it's begun.
<0106> All right...
<0107> It's time to work.
<0108> All right, let's go.
<0109> Seems like I won.
<0110> Hmph, that was easy.
<0111> This marks another step toward my brilliant future.
<0112> I guess I should open the store now.
<0113> We've got good stuff in stock.
<0114> It's a new product.
<0115> Take it.
<0116> This is a good item.
<0117> Take it from here, will you?
<0118> Thanks.
<0119> Take care of the rest.
<0120> I'm depending on you.
<0121> Okay.
<0122> Nice.
<0123> Sure...
<0124> No.
<0125> What...?
<0126> You're in luck.
<0127> Hmm?
<0128> Let's go.
<0129> Rolling the dice.
<0130> Here we go.
<0131> Oh, it's you.
<0132> Hmph...
<0133> Good.
<0134> Great job.
<0135> Oh crap.
<0136> Not that I do this oftentimes.
<0137> I'm gonna borrow this.
<0138> Let me use this.
<0139> I like this.
<0140> You have my thanks.
<0141> Santa...
<0142> It's you, huh...
<0143> Looks like I'm the winner this time.
<0144> I thought I might lose.
<0145> Nico.
<0146> Are you going through a rebellious phase now?
<0147> Be a good girl and stay put, okay?
<0148> Ugh, you have grown up.
<0149> Is that a plush... I guess not?
<0150> Now, it's business time.
<0151> Little girl, do you like toys?
<0152> Why... are you here...?
<0153> It's about the time for that event.
<0154> It's the best time of year for my business.
<0155> Today's going to be a very busy day.
<0156> All right, I'm going to go help deliver gifts.
<0157> Little girl, we have a lot of toys at our store.
<0158> Oh, did our toys call to you, little girl?
<0159> Come and buy at Rbit hobby shop.
<0160> Ugh... I'll get you a 30% discount voucher.
<0161> Welcome.
<0162> You want to play here?
<0163> Hmph.
<0164> Well, that's the way it is.
<0165> That's pretty good.
<0166> Not bad.
<0167> Cheer up. This is a special one-time thing. Take good care of it.
<0168> Boy, are you out of luck. Here, take it.
<0169> Wh-what the...
<0170> You're crazy lucky.
<0171> Happy Christmas!
