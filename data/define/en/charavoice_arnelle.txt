<0000> Heey.
<0001> Greetings.
<0002> I'm on a roll.
<0003> I have faith in you.
<0004> Fu-fu-fu.
<0005> May I?
<0006> I'll change the flow with this.
<0007> This'll do.
<0008> I'll thank myself for this later.
<0009> It's just a little prank.
<0010> Fufu, this trap will be your nightmare.
<0011> This goes right down here.
<0012> I'll do whatever it takes to win.
<0013> No hard feelings, okay?
<0014> For the sake of my victory.
<0015> I suppose this is the right course of action.
<0016> I suppose I'll show y'all what my eyes are capable of.
<0017> You'll pay for what you did to me.
<0018> Alright, I'll pay you back with interest.
<0019> I'm done lying down on the ground.
<0020> That was so humiliating...
<0021> I suppose I'll pretend now's not the right time...
<0022> Mhm?
<0023> I can't stand lazing around down here anymore.
<0024> *Tsk* Things aren't going my way.
<0025> Here I come.
<0026> I'm coming for you.
<0027> Be careful or you'll get hurt.
<0028> There we go.
<0029> Not bad.
<0030> You little...
<0031> Ugyah!
<0032> What's your deal?!
<0033> I suppose I'll take five.
<0034> Health is wealth.
<0035> Made it.
<0036> Nice, I can do my job again.
<0037> Where will I go?
<0038> Mhm, this is pretty amusing.
<0039> Where will I end up?
<0040> A warp?
<0041> This can't be happening...
<0042> Oh man, I feel off.
<0043> I screwed up.
<0044> Man, this is bad...
<0045> I'll beat you up.
<0046> I'm gonna kick the butt of anyone in my way.
<0047> Ready to grovel?
<0048> Easy target spotted.
<0049> You got some nerve challenging me...
<0050> Get the heck out of my way.
<0051> I dare you.
<0052> You should choose your fights more wisely!
<0053> Orah!
<0054> I won't go any easy on you.
<0055> Sorah!
<0056> Ahahaha!
<0057> *Tsk*
<0058> What are you doing?
<0059> Ow!
<0060> What the!?
<0061> Gyah!
<0062> Gyaah!
<0063> That hurts!!
<0064> Guboh!
<0065> You're such a slowpoke.
<0066> Kukuku.
<0067> That was a close one.
<0068> What are you trying to do?
<0069> Well, that wasn't so bad.
<0070> Have fun groveling for a while.
<0071> Wimp.
<0072> I suppose I'll move on to the next one.
<0073> What a mess I made.
<0074> Ugh, you're ridiculously strong.
<0075> Gyaaah!
<0076> Go easy on me, damn it.
<0077> Treasureâ™ª
<0078> This is so good, this is so good!
<0079> I just made a killing.
<0080> Uhihihi!
<0081> C'mon, that's not fair!
<0082> Wait up!
<0083> Agyagyah!
<0084> That's all mine... Nooo!!!
<0085> How could someone like me fall for a trap!?
<0086> Who did this!?
<0087> Getting caught in a trap is the uncoolest thing possible.
<0088> Damn it! I stepped onto a trap!
<0089> There's something foul in the air.
<0090> I wanna keep away from whatever that is.
<0091> I never saw this coming.
<0092> Here comes a boss, huh?
<0093> Treasure, of course.
<0094> I'll make all the treasure out there mine.
<0095> I'll go get the treasure.
<0096> I can't wait to discover hidden treasures around here.
<0097> Well, I'll take whatever chance I get to beat whoever's in my way.
<0098> Which one of them should I start with?
<0099> I'll smash down anyone in my way.
<0100> I suppose I'll go a bit wild.
<0101> Name's Arnelle. Good to meet ya.
<0102> You wanna buddy up with me, you say?
<0103> Well, I'll work good if you pay me good.
<0104> So, you wanna accompany me, huh?
<0105> Here starts the treasure hunt!
<0106> Well, well, where should I start?
<0107> Man, am I thrilled.
<0108> I'm winning this game for sure.
<0109> Well, that was pretty fun.
<0110> Look how much treasure I got! Ahahaha, I can't stop laughing!
<0111> And the winner is... the great Arnelle!
<0112> I'm gonna throw a party tonight.
<0113> Well done! That's a good catch.
<0114> Hey, you wanna give that to me? No?
<0115> How should we play with this stuff?
<0116> Oh, that's a good one.
<0117> Take my place, will you?
<0118> Let me take a little rest now.
<0119> I'm counting on you.
<0120> Switch time!
<0121> Got it.
<0122> I like that.
<0123> Sure.
<0124> No.
<0125> That's a bummer.
<0126> Got lucky.
<0127> What in the...?
<0128> I suppose it's go time.
<0129> There!
<0130> Good luck.
<0131> Yo!
<0132> This is uh... Mhm?
<0133> You're good.
<0134> Oh, I'm impressed.
<0135> Damn it...
<0136> Let me use this.
<0137> Mhm, this seems interesting.
<0138> Well, I hope something fun will happen.
<0139> Fufufu... I suppose I'll play this one.
<0140> How did you just take my treasure from me?!
<0141> What have you done to me?! I won't forgive you!
<0142> Oh no, my treasure! You bastard!
<0143> I can't believe I had my treasure stolen...
<0144> Should've kept your guard up.
<0145> Now this is mine.
<0146> Kukuku, you're such an easy mark.
<0147> That's worth too much for you to keep.
<0148> Okay, we can play for a bit.
<0149> Maynie, you gotta show me what you've got.
<0150> Maynie, you need punishment.
<0151> Playing with you like this once in a while isn't bad.
<0152> Fine, I'll spare you some time.
<0153> I'll play with you for a bit. Bring it.
<0154> Alright, alright, we'll play together, okay?
<0155> Huh? You want me to play with you, Maynie?
<0156> Give it up for us, the strongest team ever.
<0157> Together we can hunt whatever we want, Maynie.
<0158> You freaking out, Maynie?
<0159> Anything's possible when you and I work together.
