<0000> Like this.
<0001> It's time.
<0002> Here.
<0003> Hmph.
<0004> This is for the future.
<0005> I must execute this flawlessly.
<0006> I am prepared.
<0007> Hmm... is it time?
<0008> I should give them a lesson in prudence.
<0009> How would you like this?
<0010> You all must be alert around here.
<0011> Why not employ a more subtle strategy?
<0012> This is the time to go all out.
<0013> Never hesitate!
<0014> I'll give it my all.
<0015> Hrmm... this one!
<0016> All guns at the ready... FIRE!
<0017> I've had enough rest.
<0018> I'm ready to rise up again.
<0019> Restart all engines and take off.
<0020> Each division is required to conduct a re-inspection.
<0021> Seems I need a few more moments...
<0022> Haste makes waste.
<0023> Repairs must be done without oversights.
<0024> How embarrassing...
<0025> Advance!
<0026> Forward!
<0027> Take aim!
<0028> There!
<0029> Taking damage!
<0030> An enemy attack?!
<0031> Ugoh...
<0032> A minor inconvenience.
<0033> Good.
<0034> Oh, that feels nice.
<0035> O-ooh...
<0036> How pleasant.
<0037> Identify the currenct location immediately.
<0038> The storm is blowing me off course!
<0039> Ooo...
<0040> Such turbulent movement...
<0041> Best laid plans...
<0042> I feel my age today.
<0043> We're pulling back for now.
<0044> I must adjust my tactics.
<0045> I must get rid of obstacles.
<0046> Your stance needs work.
<0047> Let this be a lesson.
<0048> That's far enough.
<0049> Very bold of you.
<0050> Now what is this nonsense about?
<0051> Hm...?
<0052> A surprise attack...
<0053> Submit.
<0054> Guns ablaze!
<0055> Fire!
<0056> Here!
<0057> Mhm.
<0058> Hmm!
<0059> Omph!
<0060> Guoh.
<0061> Unprecedented!
<0062> Guu!
<0063> I'm sustaining major damage...!
<0064> Initiate damage control now!
<0065> Take note.
<0066> Your aim needs more work.
<0067> Like this.
<0068> Taking evasive action.
<0069> It all boils down to experience.
<0070> I hope this was a learning moment for you.
<0071> You need more discipline.
<0072> It really is a shame.
<0073> It's your win.
<0074> It's over.
<0075> I never thought you'd defeat me.
<0076> You may go ahead.
<0077> I'll put these to good use.
<0078> New funding secured.
<0079> How lovely.
<0080> A pleasant sound.
<0081> How unlucky...!
<0082> Ah, I've been robbed!
<0083> Not like this!
<0084> It's a disaster...
<0085> I slipped up.
<0086> What a blunder!
<0087> Uohh!
<0088> What?!
<0089> A mighty opponent.
<0090> I must approach carefully.
<0091> I believe I have gathered sufficient intelligence.
<0092> My instincts are warning me.
<0093> I must gather funding again.
<0094> The stars are an old friend to me.
<0095> I run a tight ship.
<0096> Budgeting is my specialty.
<0097> I'm not as young as I used to be, but...
<0098> This is my calling, after all.
<0099> This is what I'm used to.
<0100> Sometimes fighting is the only option.
<0101> What I may lack in vigor I will make up in experience.
<0102> Very well. I will guide you to victory.
<0103> Hm, me? Well, why not.
<0104> So my expertise is still needed.
<0105> Time to get some more work done.
<0106> No time like the present.
<0107> I can't afford to slack off now.
<0108> Let's put our strategy to practice.
<0109> Perfectly according to plan.
<0110> A passable performance. Next time I will do better.
<0111> This calls for a celebration.
<0112> Looks like I've still got it in me.
<0113> A reward for a job well done.
<0114> A fitting prize.
<0115> That's quite the find.
<0116> This will certainly come in handy.
<0117> Roger that.
<0118> Excellent.
<0119> Very well.
<0120> I'm afraid I must refuse.
<0121> My condolences.
<0122> Fortune smiles upon you today.
<0123> Well I'll be...
<0124> The time has come.
<0125> Let us cast the die.
<0126> Let us go.
<0127> Well met.
<0128> Hmm...?
<0129> Most excellent.
<0130> Marvelous!
<0131> Blasted!
<0132> I believe I understand the basic principle.
<0133> This seems like it'll give me the advantage.
<0134> For the sake of victory...
<0135> Desperate times call for desperate measures.
<0136> My thanks.
<0137> So the stage has been set.
<0138> May I have a moment of your time?
<0139> Is this a test?
<0140> You must pull yourself together.
<0141> Your victory isn't a free pass to grab a drink with me, you know.
<0142> It seems I still cannot see eye to eye with you.
<0143> I'm telling you to stop calling me that.
<0144> It looks like I have the last word this time.
<0145> I see... you must do what you will.
<0146> No complaints whatsoever.
<0147> Keep up the good work.
<0148> Oh boy.
<0149> Worst job ever done.
<0150> You seem to me like a significant security risk.
<0151> The fuse... have I failed?
<0152> Talk about mysterious.
<0153> I was preparing long for this moment.
<0154> All the cannons are loaded.
